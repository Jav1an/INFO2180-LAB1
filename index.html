        <p>I see myself as someone who aspires to achieve dreams that are neither excessively grand nor overly modest, 
        <br>but instead, they strike a harmonious balance between ambition and realism. My interest in web development, like many others,
        <br>marked my starting point into the world of programming. The process of assembling various elements and witnessing 
        <br>them come together into a webpage both captivated and intrigued me from the outset.</p>
